/*
 * Due to React Native's limitations with dynamic asset loading,
 * all JSON and image files must be statically imported at build time.
 * 
 * This script scans all module JSON files and their associated assets (e.g., images),
 * then generates a TypeScript file that maps each moduleâ€™s content and imports.
 * 
 * It should be run manually (for now) before building the app,
 * to ensure that all module data and assets are properly bundled into the build.

const fs = require('fs');

// I'll refactor these later

// 1. get all JSON files inside './assets/modules'
const modulesDirPath = './assets/modules';
const files = fs.readdirSync(modulesDirPath);
console.log(files);

// 2. iterate through each json files, and read its content
// the id will act as the key for the json map
// scan for all mentions of media file paths

// n. generate a TypeScript file and place it in './data'
